# Binary Trees Repository

## Overview

The `binary_trees` repository is designed for educational purposes, specifically for students of the ALX software engineering program. This repository provides a comprehensive suite of resources, including code, tests, and documentation, to help students understand and implement binary trees in various programming exercises.

## Contents

1. **Source Code (`src/`)**
    - **Header File (`binary_trees.h`)**: Contains the necessary function prototypes, type definitions, and includes. This header is essential for ensuring consistency across different source files.
    - **Source Files (`*.c`)**: Each C file implements specific operations and algorithms related to binary trees. Examples include functions for creating nodes, traversing the tree, inserting elements, and deleting nodes.

2. **Test Files (`tests/`)**
    - **Main Test Files (`main_*.c`)**: These files are designed to test the functionality of the source code. Each main file corresponds to a specific set of functions or features being tested.
    - **Test Cases (`test_cases/`)**: Organized test cases that validate the correctness and robustness of the implemented functions.

3. **Documentation (`docs/`)**
    - **README.md**: Provides an overview of the project, including setup instructions, usage examples, and a brief introduction to binary trees.
    - **Function Documentation**: Detailed descriptions of each function, including parameters, return values, and example usage. This can be included in a separate markdown file or within the source code as comments.

## Key Features

- **Binary Tree Basics**
    - Creation of binary tree nodes.
    - Insertion of elements in various orders (e.g., binary search tree insertion).
    - Tree traversal methods (in-order, pre-order, post-order).

- **Advanced Operations**
    - Deletion of nodes.
    - Calculation of tree height and depth.
    - Finding the lowest common ancestor.
    - Checking if a tree is a valid binary search tree.

- **Memory Management**
    - Proper allocation and deallocation of memory to prevent leaks.
    - Recursive and iterative implementations where applicable.

## Getting Started

To get started with the `binary_trees` repository:

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/binary_trees.git
    cd binary_trees
    ```

2. **Compile the Code**
    - Use `gcc` or any other standard C compiler to compile the source files. For example:
    ```sh
    gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic *.c -o binary_trees
    ```

3. **Run Tests**
    - Execute the test files to ensure that all functions are working correctly. For example:
    ```sh
    ./binary_trees tests/main_insert.c
    ```
